Elections are terrible. Election night is terrible. Why not feel better about everything* by colouring in?

Based on the [ODI Leeds hexmap of constituencies](https://odileeds.org/projects/hexmaps/constituencies), I’ve made a friendly printable map with little numbers and a list of declaration times. I know, but you clicked the link so you’re at least slightly as bad as I am.

*Might not make you feel better. Just go to bed. You’re only hurting yourself.
